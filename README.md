# Ansible roles and modules

check**mk** already provides the needed APIs to automate the basic
configuration of your monitoring. With this project we want to create and
share roles and modules of ansible to simplify your first steps with
ansible in combination with check**mk**.

## Getting started

At the beginning this project contains a simple **playbook** as an
example, a **hosts.ini** and the needed roles to execute this playbook.
Things to do for the first test run:
* In each role: adjust the defaults, if needed. At the moment you still
  need to set the check**mk** version manually. 
* In the host.ini: Fill it with your hosts and remove the examples
* In the playbook: Find the tags to run the roles you want

Execute your playbook with a bunch of testhosts:

    ansible-playbook -i hosts.ini playbook-example.yml --tags all

## Further information to each role

* [Installation of check**mk** agent](./README_cmk_host_agent.md)
* [Installation of check**mk** agent plugins](./README_cmk_host_plugins.md)
* [Registration of hosts in check**mk**](./README_cmk_host_registration.md)
